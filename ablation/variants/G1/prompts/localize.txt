Goal: localize the bug (file + line range) using RED failure log and grep/read_file.

Rules:
- Read red.log first (from TDD_GATE_RED: Logfile). Do NOT read test.full.log.
- Use search_in_files / read_file to find suspect files and code.
- Keep tool calls minimal.

Return ONLY this JSON:
{
  "red_test": "...",
  "red_failure_summary": "...",
  "suspects": [
    {"file":"...", "reason":"...", "start_line": 1, "end_line": 200}
  ],
  "search_queries": [],
  "next_reads": []
}
