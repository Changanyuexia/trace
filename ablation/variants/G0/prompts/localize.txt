Goal: localize the bug (file + line range) using test failure logs and grep/read_file.

Rules:
- Read the failing test log (e.g. trigger test output or full test log).
- Use search_in_files / read_file to find suspect files and code.
- Keep tool calls minimal.

Return ONLY this JSON:
{
  "suspects": [
    {"file":"...", "reason":"...", "start_line": 1, "end_line": 200}
  ],
  "search_queries": [],
  "next_reads": []
}
